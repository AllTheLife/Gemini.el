## Feedback
Please use the command `emacs -Q` and only add the gemini.el configuration to do a comparative test. If `emacs -Q` can work normally, please check your personal configuration file.

If the problem still exists in the `emacs -Q` environment, please go to [here](https://github.com/AllTheLife/Gemini.el/issues/new) to submit an issue with the content of the `*gemini*` window attached, which contains many clues to help us troubleshoot the problem.

As the developer is a high school student facing exam pressure, it is not guaranteed that bugs can be fixed in a timely manner, nor that pull requests can be accepted in a timely manner. Thank you for your understanding.

If there are any big shots willing to contribute some code, it will be greatly appreciated.
