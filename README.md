6. Add the following code to your configuration file `~/.emacs`:
```elisp

;; (setq bard-http-proxy "http://localhost:port") ;; You may need to set up a proxy if you are not in a region or country Google Bard allowed.
(require 'bard)
```

### Automatic Cookie Extraction

In addition to reading the `BARD_TOKEN` and `BARD_TOKEN_TS` environment variables or configuration file, `Bard.el` can now automatically extract the cookies from your browser. This is useful if you don't want to manually set the environment variables.

To use this feature, you need to install the `browser_cookie3` Python package. Once you have installed the package, you can run the following command to extract the cookies:

`pip install browser-cookie3`

**Note:** If you are using a browser that is not supported by [browser_cookie3](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3), you will need to manually set the `BARD_TOKEN` and `BARD_TOKEN_TS`.

## Usage

*Note*: Bard currently has limited language support, so some commands cannot be implemented temporarily.

### Chatting
- Create a `*.bard` file and chat with Bard using `bard-chat` or `bard-chat-with-multiline`

## Feedback
Please use the command `emacs -Q` and only add the bard.el configuration to do a comparative test. If `emacs -Q` can work normally, please check your personal configuration file.

If the problem still exists in the `emacs -Q` environment, please go to [here](https://github.com/AllTheLife/Bard.el/issues/new) to submit an issue with the content of the `*bard*` window attached, which contains many clues to help us troubleshoot the problem.

As the developer is a high school student facing exam pressure, it is not guaranteed that bugs can be fixed in a timely manner, nor that pull requests can be accepted in a timely manner. Thank you for your understanding.

If there are any big shots willing to contribute some code, it will be greatly appreciated.
